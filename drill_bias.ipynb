    "Some investigation into this would be necessary, as billboards do not offer a convenient route to a website beyond getting the product in question in people's minds. Website traffic is more likely to be influenced by advertising methods that are delivered on platforms that are already connected to the internet, such as emails and ads on social media or news websites. Street level advertising by way of qr codes, or simply people walking already looking at their phones, are also a more direct route to drive traffic. For the billboards to be effective, they would have to sufficiently plant the product or company in people's mind that they seek it out on their own later. Billboard placement is also an issue, as a billboard visible from a large office building could result in a higher impact on site traffic than one only visible from a busy highway."
